## Covid-19 Bus Model Presentation


In this website, we will introduce our project, go over the logistics, and put out some visualization on the outputs.

## Introduction

We are focussing on controlling the spread of the coronavirus, as it relates to reopening of schools for in-person education. Specifically, we are investigating infections of this virus in a school bus setting, with the goal to simulate the spread of COVID-19, using agent-based modeling. We will simulate the bus journey that school children travel through, and map out the bus, with programmed virtual agents (people: students and bus officials), seating in buses, movement, and the infection spread through the source patient. Agent-based modeling is a useful tool to simulate real-life events so that we donâ€™t have to create an actual experiment to further study them. This avoids any risk, costs, and human effort that experiments may entail. The purpose of our replication is to be able to observe and analyze the effect of changing measurable parameters such as passenger movement, social distancing, temperature, wearing masks, risk radius, closure of vents, etc. on the impact and spread of the virus, and understand how we can use this knowledge to set better precautions and preparations for future group travel during this pandemic, such as children going to school, and minimize disease infection risk among the population. Our results will include guidelines on key parameters to focus on for safe school reopening.
